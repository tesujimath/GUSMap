\title{FS method: Write linkage groups/maps to file}
\usage{
FSobj$writeLM(file, direct = "./", LG = NULL, what = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Character value giving the name of the file to write to.}

\item{direct}{Character value for the directory to write the file to (relative to the current working working directory)}

\item{LG}{Integer vector giving the indices of the linkage groups to write. If \code{NULL}, the results for all the 
linkage groups are returned.}

\item{what}{Character vector specifying whether the combined linkage groups \code{"LG-comb"} are to be 
returned or the linkage mapping results \code{"map"}.}
}
\value{
The function returns a csv file with the rows representing the SNPs and the columns containing the linkage group and linkage map 
information.
The columns of the file are:
\describe{
\item{LG}{The linkage number as given in the output from the FS object.}
\item{LG_POS}{The position of the SNPs across the linkage group. Starts at 1 and
increases by one for each SNP in the same linkage group.}
\item{CHROM}{The chromosome name the SNP was located on in the original genomic assembly.}
\item{POS}{The position (in base pairs) of the SNP on the original genomic assembly.}
\item{TYPE}{The segregation type of the SNP. Either BI (both-informative), 
MI (maternal-informative) or PI (paternal-informative).}
\item{RF_PAT}{The sum of the recombination fraction estimates for the paternal meioses. Starts at zero
for the first SNP in the linkage groups and increases across the linkage group.}
\item{RF_MAT}{The sum of the recombination fraction estimates for the maternal meioses. Starts at zero
for the first SNP in the linkage groups and increases across the linkage group.}
\item{ERR}{The sequencing error estimate for the SNP.}
\item{MEAN_DEPTH}{The mean read depth of the SNP.}
\item{CALLRATE}{The proportion of individuals in which there is at least one read across the SNP.}
}
If no linkage maps have been computed (using the \code{\link{$computeMap}}), then the
columns RF_PAT, RF_MAT and ERR are not returned.

\description{
Method for writing results from a linkage analysis in GUSMap to a file.
}
\details{
The linkage groups written to file are the combined linkage groups produced by \code{\link{$addBIsnps}} and
ordered using \code{\link{$orderLG}}. If linkage maps are also computed using \code{\link{$computeMap}}, then 
information regarding the parameters estimates for the maps are also returned.

When \code{what = NULL}, the linkage mapping results computed using the \code{\link{$computeMap}} function are returned
if they are available, otherwise the combined linkage groups information is returned.

\examples{
## Simulate some sequencing data
set.seed(6745)
config <- list(list(sample(c(1,2,4), size=30, replace=TRUE)))
F1data <- simFS(0.01, config=config, meanDepth=10, nInd=50)
## Compute 2-point recombination fractions
F1data$rf_2pt(nClust=1)
## create and order linkage groups
F1data$createLG()
F1data$addBIsnps()
F1data$orderLG(ndim=5)
F1data$computeMap()

## return the results to a file
F1data$writeLM(file = "test")
