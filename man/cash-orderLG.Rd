\title{FS method: Order linkage groups}
\usage{
FSobj$orderLG(chrom = NULL, mapfun = "haldane", weight="LOD2", ndim=30)
}
\arguments{
\item{chrom}{An integer vector of the indices for the linkage group(s) that are to be ordered.}

\item{mapfun}{A character value for the mapping function to be used. For a list of available mapping functions,
see \code{\link{mfun}}.}

\item{weight}{A character value for the weight function to be used. Can be either
\code{"none"}, \code{"LOD"} or \code{"LOD2"}.}

\item{ndim}{A integer value for the number of dimensions to use in the unconstrained MDS step.}
}
\description{
Method for ordering markers in a linkage group
}
\details{
The combined linkage groups created using the \code{\link{$addBIsnps}} are ordered using the multidimensional scaling (MDS)
approach described by \insertCite{preedy2016tag;textual}{GUSMap}. In brief, the MDS approach starts by performing weighted unconstrained 
MDS on the matrix of genetic map distances, where the dimension of the weighted unconstrained MDS is controlled by the \code{ndim} argument.
In the second step, a principal curve is fitted and the projection of the markers into the first principal curve gives the marker order.

There are three different types weigthing matrix that can be used:
\itemize{
\item{No weights \code{"none"}: }{The weight of each SNP pair is set to 1 with the expection that the weigths between 
a MI and PI pair are set to 0 since there is not information of recombination in these SNP pairs.}
\item{LOD score \code{"LOD"}: }{The weighting matrix corresponds to the matrix of pariwise LOD scores.}
\item{Squared LOD scores \code{"LOD"}:}{The weighting matrix corresponds to the matrix of squared pariwise LOD scores.}
}
}
\examples{
## Simulate some sequencing data
set.seed(6745)
config <- list(list(sample(c(1,2,4), size=30, replace=TRUE)))
F1data <- simFS(0.01, config=config, meanDepth=10, nInd=50) 
## Compute 2-point recombination fractions
F1data$rf_2pt()
## create paternal and maternal linkage groups
F1data$createLG()
## Add the BI SNPs
F1data$addBIsnps()

## Order Linkage groups
F1data$orderLG(ndim=5)
