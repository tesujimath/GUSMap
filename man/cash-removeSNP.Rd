\title{BC and FS method: Remove SNP from Linkage Group}
\usage{
BCobj$removeSNP(snps, where = NULL)
FSobj$removeSNP(snps, where = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{snps}{An integer vector giving the indices of the SNP to be removed.}

\item{where}{Character vector specifying which set of linkage groups to remove SNPs from (see details).}
}
\description{
Method for removing SNPs from linkage groups in an BC or FS object.
}
\details{
For a linkage analysis in GUSMap, there may be a need to delete linkage groups from the
list of created linkage groups. The indices of the linkage groups corresponds to the number
given in the output for the FS object. More than one linkage group can be deleted at once.

Note: When the linkage group(s) are deleted, the indices of the remaining linkage groups 
changes. Print the BC or FS object to investiage what these are after running this function.

\code{BC} obsject: When \code{where = "LG-pts"}, SNPs will be removed from the set of pseudo-testcross 
linkage groups created via the \code{\link{$createLG}} function. On the other hand, if 
\code{where = "LG-bi"}, then SNPs from the set of pseudo-testcross linkage groups with BI SNPs added
created from the \code{\link{$addBIsnps}} function will be removed.
When \code{where = NULL}, SNPs will be removed from the set of pseudo-testcross linkage groups with BI SNPs added if available,
otherwise they will be removed from the set of pseudo-testcross linkage groups.

\code{FS} obsject: When \code{where = "LG-pts"}, SNPs will be removed from the set of pseudo-testcross 
linkage groups created via the \code{\link{$createLG}} function. On the other hand, if 
\code{where = "LG-comb"}, then SNPs from the set of combined linkage groups 
created from the \code{\link{$addBIsnps}} function will be removed.
When \code{where = NULL}, SNPs will be removed from the set of combined linkage groups if available,
otherwise they will be removed from the set of pseudo-testcross linkage groups.

## Simulate some sequencing data
set.seed(6745)
config <- list(list(sample(c(1,2,4), size=20, replace=TRUE)))
F1data <- simFS(0.01, config=config, meanDepth=10, nInd=50) 
## Compute 2-point recombination fractions
F1data$rf_2pt()
## create paternal and maternal linkage groups
F1data$createLG()

## Remove SNPs 3,7,15,20 from the linkage groups
F1data$removeSNP(snps = c(3,7,15,20))
